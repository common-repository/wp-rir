Uses the service from rir.li to prevent you to do image hotlinking.

== Description ==

Uses the service from [rir.li](http://rir.li) to prevent you to do image hotlinking.

Rir.li it's an improved clone of the old imgred.com service.

**Usage**:
Once itâ€™s installed, you can use it to copy any images in the service of rir.li like this in your post text:

< rir > http://www.turisbot.com/images/maastricht.jpg < / rir >

or

[rir]http://www.turisbot.com/images/maastricht.jpg[/rir]
